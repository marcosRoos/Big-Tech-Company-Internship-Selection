*My first try on a big tech company test for internship;  
The original enunciated was in portuguese, because of this, 
it may have some portuguese words on the code and on the questions;  
POA/RS - BRAZIL;*  
  
========================================================================  
  
## **Questions :**  
  
1 ) Create an algorithm ( as you wish ) wich answer a 4x4 sudoku.  
  
2 ) Create an algorithm ( as you wish ) wich returns the days it takes for a dev  
team to finish a job. it should receive 4 levels of developers, the quantity of them  
and how much effort it takes to end the job.  
  
## Effort Table  
Junior | takes 14 days to produce 1 effort point &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp //junior developer   
Pleno  | takes 7 days to produce 2 effort points &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp // developer   
Senior | takes a day to produce 1 effort point &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp // Senior developer   
Líder Técnico | takes a day to produce 3 effort points &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp // Tech leader   
  
Exemple  
{  
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp input :  
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp { [ 2, 3, 4, 1], [ "Junior", "Pleno", "Senior", "LT"], 112 }    
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp output :  
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 14 dias    // 14 days   
}  
  
3 )  create an algorithm ( as you wish ) wich takes 2 numbers, and from the greater one print  
the reverse fibonacci sequence.  
  
4 ) create and algorithm ( as you wish ) wich takes a string and returns the greater number  
of repetitions of letters on the string.
